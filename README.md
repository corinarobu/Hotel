The presented web application is a platform designed for both hotel clients and 
administrators. Clients can create accounts, make online reservations through the secure Stripe 
payment system, view the restaurant menu, check the location on the map, and read 
recommendations from other users. The system also includes a FAQ section and allows clients 
who have made a reservation to provide ratings. 
Administrators have access to a control panel through which they can manage users, 
rooms, menus, and recommendations. The application is built on a modular architecture, using 
ASP.NET Core for the backend and Angular for the frontend, ensuring security, scalability, and 
a user-friendly experience.
